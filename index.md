## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 1, Part 1

  I enjoyed this lab because it was a very good introduction to the course overall. This was my first time using Linux and any coding software like C++, so it was enjoyable to begin to understand how these systems work. Learning the commands to access directories like $ls was useful up until the most recent lab, and our first experiences with "Hello World" intorduced us to the use of VScode.

* Lab 9, Part 2

  I enjoyed this lab as well, because I am familar with the Philisopher's problem. Our use of strings and if statements in order to validate each schedule's legitimacy really allowed for us to understand the concept of string breaks and provided a refresher on if statements that we were introduced to in lab 6.

* Lab 11, Part 2

  I enjoyed this lab as it was a reminder of how far we have come from the original Hi-Lo game we created in our labs. With this game, we were able to use all of the concepts we had learnt up to this point including 4 loops, string breask, and if statements to create a more complex version of the simple game we created in the first few labs.
